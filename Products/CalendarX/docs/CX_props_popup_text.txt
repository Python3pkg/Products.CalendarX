Instructions for properties in CX_props_popup.

Use the Properties tab to adjust the attributes of the 
  rollover PopUp text that displays when you rollover each
  event displayed on the calendar.  Just check off the ones 
  that you want to show up.  There's a howto on the CalendarX.org 
  website that explains how you can add other attributes as well.  
Technical Note:  These values represent the metadata that are stored in
  the portal_catalog for each event.  If you want to display other 
  information about the event that is NOT in the metadata, you can 
  read the howto on the CalendarX.org website that explains how 
  you can add other attributes as well.
