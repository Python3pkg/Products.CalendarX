ToDo list as seen at launch for CalendarX 0.9.5(stable)
=======================================================

* Remove without pity definitively all that's marked as deprecated.

* rout the mouseover display bugs.  there are several where the calendar cells
  are not properly highlighted when you mouseover an event, especially events
  that span two days or two months or differences between the regular events and
  the ones in the "continuing" listing on weekbyhour and multimonth views.
  non-critical (exist in 0.6.6 too) but frustrating.

* test everything else too

* document how to do everything in Plone 3

* get recurring events working (via vs.event)

* use standard Plone color codes (dtml vars) when relevant.

* use Products.ColorField in place of hex strings in edit forms

* use standard Plone vocabularies where applicable (workflow states, ...)
