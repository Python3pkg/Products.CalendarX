This is an attempt to port CalendarX to Plone 3 based on on the last stable release - version 0.6.6. Our first effort has been to move to an Archetypes based schema by migrating most of the property sheets to AT schemata.

The next step is to get the current views and scripts working as is. This will be followed by trimming the fat off of the schema and making it 'smarter'.
